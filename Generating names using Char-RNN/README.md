# Character level language model - Name Generation

___

* In this project we'll apply a Character level RNN model to generate new Dinosaur names.
* A list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into this [dataset](dinos.txt). 
* To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character level language model to generate new names. * Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names.
* This datasets and files used in this project is a part of the `deeplearning.ai`'s Specialization, Course 5: Natural Language Processing.
