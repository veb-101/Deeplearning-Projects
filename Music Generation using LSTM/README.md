# Creating Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network

-----

* In this notebook, you will implement a model that uses an `LSTM` to generate music. You will even be able to listen to your own music at the end.

* You will learn to:
  * Apply an LSTM to music generation.
  * Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.

* You will train a network to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work.
* This datasets and files used in this project is a part of the `deeplearning.ai`'s Specialization, Course 5: Natural Language Processing.
